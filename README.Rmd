The goal of linecrossR is to fit and visualize hybrid fitness models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of linecrossR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("KnechtTheDots/linecrossR")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(linecrossR)

dmi_plot(.5, .5, .5)

```
